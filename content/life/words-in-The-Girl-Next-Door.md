<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>道德品行，什么是道德品行？我 的意思是～～很有趣，过去我认为就是说实话，做好事，你知道，基本上就是做个该死的童子军。但是后来，我有了不同的看法，现在我觉得道德品行就是，找到自 己真正关心的一件东西，特别的那一样东西，它对你来说，比世界上任何其他东西都更有意义。当你找到她，你为她而战，你不计后果，你把她放在一切的首位，你 的生活，你的未来，一切的一切，也许你为她做的那些事不是那么干净。你知道吗？不要紧。因为在你心底，你知道，这事值得去做。这，就是道德品行。</span><wbr></wbr></span>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Moral fiber. So, what is moral fiber?
It's funny, I used to think it was always telling the truth, doing good deeds, basically being a fucking boy scout.   But lately I've been seeing it differently.   Now I think moral fiber's about finding that one thing you really care about.   That one special thing that means more to you than anything else in the world.   And when you find her, you fight for her.   You risk it all, you put her in front of everything, your life, all of it.   And maybe the stuff you do to help her isn't so clean. You know what? It doesn't matter.   Because in your heart you know, that the juice is worth the squeeze.   That's what moral fiber's all about.
